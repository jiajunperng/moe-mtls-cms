<p>The Mother Tongue Languages Symposium (MTLS) is an annual event co-organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee (MLLPC) and the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee (TLLPC).</p>
	
<p>This year, MTLS will be a hybrid event featuring both physical and online components.</p>
	
<p>After ten iterations, MTLS has established its own branding and achieved its intended outcomes considerably. It is an annual event that many children, parents, community partners and MTL educators look forward to.</p>
